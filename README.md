# The Birthday Bot
You can play this project in the slack channel. It automatically sends messages when it's someone's birthday. This is how we put our fellow students in the spotlight

# Why we chose this project
We chose this project because we wanted people to not forget each others birthday and when you get a message with that it is someone's birthday that you talk to the person and wish the lucky one a happy birthday.

# How to install extensions
I’ll be using the `npm` package manager to install these packages, but you can also use `yarn`.

install Node.js v12 or higher
- `nodemon`: a tool that automatically restarts a Node.js application when file changes in the directory are detected
- `dotenv`: a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env

install 
```
npm add -D nodemon dotenv 
```
# How to start running
```
npm run dev
```
- Run the npm run dev script in your terminal. 
- You should get a message in your terminal reading `⚡️ Slack Bolt app is running on port 3000!`
